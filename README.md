# SportsPro Technical Support - Assignment 1

## Important Note

**For Assignment 1:** Implement basic functionality without complex authentication.
- For the customer login page, simply check if the email exists in the database or hard code it 
- No password validation or session management required

**Authentication, security features, and proper login functionality will be implemented in Assignment 2.**

## Getting Started

This repository contains HTML templates and CSS for all required pages. You need to:

1. Implement the PostgreSQL database
2. Create Express.js API endpoints
3. Connect the frontend
4. Configure Docker and Nginx (reverse proxy + load balancing)

Good luck!
